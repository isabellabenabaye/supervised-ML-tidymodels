glimpse(stack_overflow)

stack_overflow %>% 
  count(remote, sort = TRUE)

stack_overflow %>% 
  count(country, sort = TRUE)
```

Remote: there are way more people who don't work remotely than those that do. The dataset is imbalanced.

Country: Most of the respondents are from the U.S. (~50%), then the U.K. (18%). The rest of the 32% of the respondents are from Germanu, India, and Canada.
